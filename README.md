- ***Modify your Add Task form to save the data entered in as a Task in your local database.***
- ***Refactor your homepageâ€™s RecyclerView to display all Task entities in your database.***
- ***Ensure that the description and status of a tapped task are also displayed on the detail page, in addition to the title. (Note that you can accomplish this by passing along the entire Task entity, or by passing along only its ID in the intent.)***
- ***When I delete the task, it will delete from the database***<br>
